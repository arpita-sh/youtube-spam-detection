YouTube Comment Spam Detection


This repository contains a Python-based natural language processing project designed to classify YouTube comments as spam or non-spam. The project follows a clear workflow of data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training using Logistic Regression, and evaluation.

Features:


Data Cleaning: Preprocesses text by removing stop words, contractions, and escape characters.

Feature Extraction: Uses CountVectorizer and TF-IDF transformation to represent text data.

Model Training: Employs Logistic Regression for spam detection.

Evaluation: Includes confusion matrix, accuracy score, and 5-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance.

Prediction: Tests the model on new comments to classify them as spam or non-spam.
